## 📜 Overview

With the rise of generative AI, distinguishing authentic media from synthetic (deepfake) media has become a critical challenge. This project addresses this issue by implementing a robust deepfake detection system. The model is trained to identify subtle artifacts and inconsistencies in images that are often invisible to the naked eye.

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

The solution is centered around **MobileNetV2**, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its computational efficiency and strong performance.

* **Pre-trained Base:** Utilizes weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, leveraging transfer learning.
* **Custom Head:** A custom classification layer (GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout, and a Dense layer with a Sigmoid activation) is added on top of the base model for the binary classification task.
* **Fine-Tuning:** The entire model was fine-tuned to adapt its learned features specifically for deepfake detection.
